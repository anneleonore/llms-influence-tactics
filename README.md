# Large Language Models and Influence Tactics

## About the Project
This project involves evaluating the ability of ***large language models*** to identify ***influence tactics*** in negotiation dialogue through prompting. We're testing the models' ***inference capabilities*** by providing them with varying levels of contextual information and assessing their performance. By doing so, we're exploring the models' ***ability to identify*** different influence tactics.

### Dependencies

## Prompting
We used one-shot and few-shot prompting to test the models' ability to identify influence tactics in negotiation dialogue. We provided different levels of contextual information to assess model performance. 

## LLMs
We compared the performance of four open-source LLms:
1. Llama-3.1-8B [(Meta AI, 2024)](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B)
2. gemma-2-2b-it [(Gemma Team, 2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/m/3301)
3. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 [(Jiang et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825)
4. Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct [(Qwen Team, 2024)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/)

## Influence Tactics
Our analysis focused on the following influence tactics:
1. Give compliment
2. Show empathy
3. Ask politely
4. State preference
5. Communicate rationale
6. Take control of conversation
7. Workout compromise
